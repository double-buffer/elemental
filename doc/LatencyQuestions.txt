frametime: 8ms


ScÃ©narios:

1 frame latency configured

1) CPU + GPU Work done in 4 MS 
2) CPU 2MS + GPU 10 MS => Miss next vsync for one frame
3) Same but for several frames
4) CPU 6MS + GPU 4 MS => Miss next vsync

Do the same for 2 frame latency

Also if we know we can do 30 FPS. how can we do that on a 120hz screen
